Why separate them?
A Node object doesn't know it's in a list; it only knows its own value and the next "clue" in the chain. If you used a Node as your main "list" object, it would be messy. 
Think about these three reasons why the LinkedList "Manager" is necessary:

    Representing "Empty":
        If you only had a Node class, how would you represent an empty list? A Node always has a value.
        The LinkedList manager starts with self.head = None. That's how it says, "I exist, but I'm currently empty".
    Tracking the "Entry Point":
        In a linked list, if you lose the first node, you lose the entire list because there's no way to find the others.
        The LinkedList manager acts as a permanent "bookmark" for the start of the chain.
    Hiding the "Messy" Work:
        Without a manager, every time you wanted to add data, you'd have to write a while loop manually in your main code.
        The manager "abstracts" this. You just call .append("Data"), and the manager handles the complex traversal and pointer logic behind the scenes. 

The "Bus Line" Analogy

    The Node is a Bus Stop. It knows which stop comes next, but it doesn't know the name of the whole route or how many stops are left.
    The LinkedList is the Bus Route Map. It’s the "Manager" that knows where the route starts and has the power to add new stops to the line. 

The logic is clear: You keep them separate so the data (Node) doesn't have to worry about the organization (LinkedList). 
Do you want to see how the manager would handle deleting a node, which is a bit trickier than appending?
